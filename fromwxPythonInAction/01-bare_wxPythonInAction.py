#	This basic wxPython program illustrates the five basic steps you
#	must complete for every wxPython program you develop:


import wx				#		1 Import the necessary wxPython package

class App(wx.App):		#		2 Subclass the wxPython application class
	def OnInit(self):	#		3 Define an application initialization method
		frame = wx.Frame(parent=None, title='Bare')
		frame.Show()
		return True

app = App()				#		4 Create an application class instance
app.MainLoop()			#		5 Enter the applicationâ€™s main event loop
